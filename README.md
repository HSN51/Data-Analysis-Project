# Students Exam Performance Analysis

This project aims to analyze students' exam performance using the 'Students Performance in Exams' dataset. Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), basic statistical analysis, data visualization and feature engineering steps were applied in the project.

## Data set

2. **Creating a Google Colab File**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
4. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
5. **Basic Statistical Analyzes**
6. **Visualization**
7. **Analysis of Relationships Between Variables**
8. **Feature Engineering**

## How to use
1. Clone or download this repository to your own computer.
2. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and upload the `VeriAnaliziProjesi.ipynb` file.
3. Perform analyzes by running the codes in the Colab file. The Colab file will automatically download the dataset from Kaggle.

## Key Findings
- A high correlation was found between math, reading and writing scores.
- Factors such as students' gender and whether a test preparation course has been taken affect exam performance.
